# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

This Capstone project is the final (10th) course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, designed to bring together and apply all the knowledge gained throughout the program in a comprehensive project.

## Project Background:
SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry by making space travel more affordable. With Falcon 9 rocket launches priced at $62 million, significantly lower than the $165 million charged by other providers, SpaceX achieves this cost efficiency largely through the reuse of the first stage of its rockets. By predicting whether the first stage will successfully land, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This project uses publicly available data and machine learning models to predict the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage.

## Questions to be Answered:

How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits impact the success of the first-stage landing?
Has the success rate of landings improved over the years?
Which algorithm is the most effective for binary classification in this scenario?
## Methodology:

### Data Collection:

Using the SpaceX REST API
Web Scraping from Wikipedia
### Data Wrangling:

Filtering the data
Handling missing values
Applying One Hot Encoding to prepare the data for binary classification
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilizing visualization and SQL for data exploration
### Interactive Visual Analytics:

Implementing Folium and Plotly Dash for interactive visualizations
### Predictive Analysis:

Building, tuning, and evaluating classification models to achieve optimal results
